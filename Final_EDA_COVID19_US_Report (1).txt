A Deep Dive into the COVID-19 Impact Across U.S. States
Introduction
COVID-19 has been the defining global health crisis of our time. This report delves into the pandemic's varying impact across select U.S. states. We'll explore how the number of positive cases correlates with hospitalizations and fatalities.
Data Summary
Our data comes from the COVID-19 Tracking Project and covers a range of variables from 15,633 records across 55 attributes. This rich dataset offers an opportunity to assess the pandemic's impact through multiple lenses. For this report, we focus on the number of positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Python Code:
df = pd.read_csv('us_states_covid19_daily.csv')
df.describe()
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using summary statistics and graphical analyses, we can tease out patterns and correlations. For instance, the average number of positive cases across the selected states stands at around 100,487.

Inference
Our analysis unveils a strong correlation between positive cases and the strain on healthcare systems. This is crucial for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation.
Python Code:
sns.heatmap(df_subset.corr(), annot=True)
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact varies significantly across states. The insights from this report can guide healthcare policies and interventions, providing a data-driven foundation for tackling the crisis.
